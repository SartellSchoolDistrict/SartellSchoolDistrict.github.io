        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>This website was created as a central hub for Sartell Studentâ€™s
          programming projects; however, it was not always so. The Github site
          itself was created by a student. Amanda Holstrom, an Instructional
          Technology Specialist at Sartell Middle School was tasked with
          recreating a website that was used for teaching math when that website
          was shut down. Because of her busy schedule, Ms. Holstrom recruited
          John Rivard, a 8th grade student who loved to program. This website was first
          used as a testing ground for John Rivard. Now it is used as a central hub for all
          programming projects made by students at any of the Sartell Schools.
